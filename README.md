YUIWin8Duck
===========

This is the a simple game derived from the YUI duck shooter demo (http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/node/ducks.html) showing YUI working directly inside a Windows 8 App and a Windows Phone 8 App.
It's the code that is demoed in this blog post: http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2013/03/12/windows-8-loves-yui/


Web: version of app that runs in a browser, basically the YUI demo with a bit of CSS (can run on the Xbox too!)

Win8: same version of the web with the YUI library locally so the App can run completely local as a Windows 8 App

WP8: same version of the web, YUI locally, Windows Phone 8 Project.
